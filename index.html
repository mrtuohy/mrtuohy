<h1> SNOW ANNOUNCEMENT! </h1>
<br>
<h2>Web Design & Intro To Computer Science Students - Your Projects Will Be Shortened!
<br>
AP CSP Students - You will still have 8 hours of Class Time to work on your Explore Task - don't worry, nothing much changes for you!
<br>
Web Design Students: Plan on completing your Proposal/Portfolio (Part 1) and your Mock Up (Part 2) - Don't worry about Part 3.
<br>
Intro To Computer Science Students: Plan on completing your Proposal (Part 1) and Prototype (Part 2 - your Minimum Viable Product). <br>
It is alright to reduce the scope of your project, too - you can have 2 key elements instead of 3 in your Proposal and Prototype.
<br>
This will all be discussed in class, too :)
