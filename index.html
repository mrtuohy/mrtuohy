    <h2>For AP Computer Science Principles Students</h2>
    <h3>The AP folk just posted a big update about how a lot of their AP stuff is going to be handled. You can see it here: <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update">Link To AP Update</a></h3>
    <h4><b>Explore Task + Create Task only; no multiple-choice exam. 	Digital Portfolio due date extended for all students to May 26 at 11:59 p.m. ET</b></h4>
    
    <p>Students will need to complete the Create Task at home, by themselves.<br>
    As we will be begining 'Online Classes' on April 20, I will be setting THREE WEEKS of time aside for you to work on the Create Task.<br>
    I will have some small goals and check-in tasks to help keep you on track during that time... but... it's up to you to get it done and turned in <br>
    If you have questions, I will answer as well as I can, as there are some things I can't tell you for the Create task...<br>
    ...but ALWAYS feel free to ask any question you want!  Even if I can't give you the direct answer, I will find a way to say *something* helpful!<br>
    We only have Unit 5 Lesson 12 through Lesson 17 left!<br>
    We will be finishing that off by May 1st, so the month of May can be focused entierly on the Create Task.<br>
