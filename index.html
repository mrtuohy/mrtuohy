  <h2>For AP Computer Science Principles Students</h2><pre>
    Please Keep Watching This Space For Updates
    Currently we do not know how the AP board are going to handle AP classes, and AP CSP specifically...
    ...so let's hope for the best, but plan for the worst. The safest thing to do is assume that these current dates will NOT be moved. 
    I will update and underline anything in the list below if they get moved to a later time/canceled/etc.<list>
    <ul>Currenly the AP CSP Create Task date is due no later than April 30th, 8pm (11pm Eastern)</ul>
    <ul>Currenly the AP CSP Exam date is 8am, Friday May 15. </ul></list>
    Please Keep Watching This Space For Updates!
    
    <h2>Advice for AP Computer Science Principles Students</h2><list>
    <ul>Don't panic. We were nearly done with the course material - we only have Unit 5 Lesson 12 through Lesson 17 left!</ul>
    <ul>Consider working through those last few lessons - it's not that much to do, and it's kinda fun.</ul>
    <ul>Spend about 5-10 mins a day reviewing one of the earlier units. 5 mins can be enough, but you have to do it every day!</ul>
    <ul>Consider taking a look at the 'Create' task - it's the next section on Code.org (it's unlocked now). 
        Even though we are required to give you 12 hours of class time to work on it, that's physically impossible for us to do - but that doesn't mean the AP will move the due date.
        So, consider taking a little time next week reading over things just in case you have to end up doing it from home. 
        The good news is that - before winter break - you knew enough code to do the Create task.
        If you end up having to work on it from home, don't worry, I'll update this site with further advice and such.
        One way or another, it'll be okay.</ul>
