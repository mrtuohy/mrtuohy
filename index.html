    <h2>For AP Computer Science Principles Students</h2>
    <h3>Please Keep Watching This Space For (more) Updates!</h3>
    <h3><b>*HUGE UPDATE - Friday, 3/20/2020*</b></h3>
    <h3>The AP folk just posted a big update about how a lot of their AP stuff is going to be handled. You can see it here: <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update">Link To AP Update</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Did you see the part in the table that said:</h4>
    <h4><b>Explore Task + Create Task only; no multiple-choice exam. 	Digital Portfolio due date extended for all students to May 26 at 11:59 p.m. ET</b></h4>
    Wow - right?<br>
    So what does this mean?<br>
    It looks as though the AP people are saying that your AP will be based entirely on the results of your Create and Explore tasks, not just 12% (Explore) and 28%(Create) like originally planned.<br>
    I personally think this is good news for you all.<br>
    Unlike a multiple choice exam - you know all of the questions in advance, and you have plenty of time to perfect your answers to get them all right!<br>
    You can all look and see the documentation on Code.Org right now and if you want, you can even get started right now (I unlocked the AP Create Task unit two Fridays ago).<br>
    If you do get started, I strongly recommend waiting until we know more about our school's specific plan before submitting it, though! ðŸ™‚<br>
    
    While I'll need to consult with Mr. Stutler to confirm what our AP CS Principles plans will be, I suspect one of the two following scenarios will play out:<br>
    <ol><li> We will return to school before the May 26 Deadline, and we'll spend class time - at least the required 12 hours (2 1/2 weeks) of class time doing the Create task.</li>
    <li>#2 We don't return to school in time to have the 12 Hours of class time. If it looks like that will happen, Students will need to complete the Create task outside of class.</li>
    </ol>
    I was never supposed to be helping much with the Create Task anyway - but regardless of how this all goes down - I will try to provide as much guidance as I am allowed to.<br>
    If you have questions, ask them, and I will do my best to answer them.<br> 
    <br>
    I will continue to update this site as I learn more... but that's actually starting to look like a real plan, right?<br>
    
    <h2>Advice for AP Computer Science Principles Students</h2><list><ul>
    <li>Don't panic. We were nearly done with the course material - we only have Unit 5 Lesson 12 through Lesson 17 left!</li>
    <li>Consider working through those last few lessons - it's not that much to do, and it's kinda fun. - But Only If You Want To - It Is Not Required!</li>
    <li>Spend about 5-10 mins a day reviewing one of the earlier units. 5 mins can be enough, but you have to do it every day!</li>
    <li>Consider taking a look at the 'Create' task - it's the next section on Code.org (it's unlocked now). 
    Even though we are required to give you 12 hours of class time to work on it, that's physically impossible for us to do - but that doesn't mean the AP will move the due date.
    So, consider taking a little time next week reading over things just in case you have to end up doing it from home. 
    The good news is that - before winter break - you knew enough code to do the Create task.
    If you end up having to work on it from home, don't worry, I'll update this site with further advice and such.
    One way or another, it'll be okay.</li></ul></pre></font>
