<h1>Intro to Computer Science – Summer 2020 Syllabus<h1>
<h2>Mr. Tuohy – <a href="mailto:TuohyC@issaquah.wednet.edu">TuohyC@issaquah.wednet.edu</a><h2>
Welcome to Intro CS! This class is focused on teaching the principles and logic that are key to understanding how most programming languages work, and not on teaching the specific syntax of one specific programming language.
In other words, the goal of the class is to learn how to think like a software developer. 

<h2>Why is that important?</h2>
The current workplace has lots of people who work with code – and the future will have even more. The ability to think like, understand, and communicate with software developers – whether you will be a software developer yourself or not – is an incredibly important skill that only becomes more important every year. 
This class requires no previous experience programming, but it does require hard work, flexibility, and a self-starting positive attitude!

<h2>We’re Online! …what does that mean and what is expected of me?</h2>
If we were in a physical classroom, I’d have a list of rules and such and talk about what sort of behavior is expected from you. It’d be a long and boring but necessary read.
This is a high-speed high-school semester, worth high-school credit, where we will cover all of the same material in a vastly reduced amount of time. 
So I don’t want students to act like you would in a regular class – you’re going to need to be <b>better</b> than that.

I’m also a CTE teacher – so – I tend to have and teach ‘workplace expectations’ with my students. There are downsides and upsides to this:<ul>
<li>The downsides are that I’ll expect work to be completed and turned in by specific times, and I expect you to treat it like a job and be professional and adult about the class.</li>
<li>The upsides are that like a (good) workplace, I won’t micromanage you or give you busywork. Assignments will be due by a certain time and you’ll be trusted to do what you need to do to complete them. I’ll also treat you like an adult, and let you make decisions about what you need.</li>
</ul>
Please note, I don’t expect *anyone* to not need help – either occasionally or all the time.
It’s an Intro class, you aren’t supposed to know any of this yet!

<h2>Teaching Style Of This Class</h2>

The style of the class itself is heavily based on the concept of ‘Exploratory Learning’ –unlike other classes, I’m not going to tell you how to do it. I might tell you how to do something similar, but the whole point is to figure it out for yourself. I give a lot of hints, but you will need to think and try. If you don’t, you won’t have those ‘Ohhh – I get it!’ moments, and this class is built on those moments.

To get a bit more in-depth on this (I studied Psychology, humor me) It’s ‘Growth Mindset’ vs ‘Fixed Mindset’ – and this class is a good place to learn how to have a ‘Growth Mindset’ because this class is based on trial and error. 
This is a class where you try something, and when it doesn’t work – you’ve learned that one specific approach doesn’t work. And then you’ll need to learn why it doesn’t work, and with that new knowledge, you’ll try something else. You might eventually get the answer… but… who cares? You’ll have grown with every attempt and analysis. 
You’ll get out what you put in, and there’s always something to learn. That’s a ‘Growth Mindset’ – approaching this to see what you can get out of it.
If you come into this class with a ‘Fixed Mindset’ – then you might be the type that will get frustrated and give up or immediately ask for help when the first thing you try doesn’t work. That won’t work great in this class. 
Think of it this way instead: You aren’t wrong – you’re testing something.
Any time you place code down and run it – you’re testing it – you are experimenting – you are seeking and finding the things that work and the things that don’t.
It’s like solving a puzzle.
And is every twist of a Rubic’s Cube ‘wrong’ until the last one where everything lines up? Of course not. The same goes for Computer Science and code. 
It’s puzzle solving. It’s experimentation. 

Having said all that – Ask Questions!  You are <b>NOT</b> on your own.
You will be able to ask questions (including pasting links to your work or even images of things causing you problems) through the Canvas messaging system, which we will go over at the very beginning of the semester. If for some reason the Canvas messaging doesn’t work, you can also email me at TuohyC@issaquah.wednet.edu as a backup.

<h2>How Fast Are We Going Over The Summer? / And What About Attendance?</h2>

There isn’t much room for absence in this short summer session. 
Intro to Computer Science would usually be a minimum of 90 days of in-class time.

This class goes from July 6-17 Monday – Friday 8:00 AM – 3:00 PM 
That’s 10 days to cover 90+ days of class; about two weeks of material a day.

Family Vacation planned? You’ll need to miss a few days?
That’s… not going to work, seeing as that missing just two days is the equivalent of missing 3-4 weeks of class. 
For this reason, WANIC are strict about attendance – especially with any classes that give high-school credit in such a short period. 
Please contact WANIC about the specifics of the absence policies if you have any questions; all I can say is that more than a single day of absence has, in the past, been considered enough to be considered incomplete or withdrawn from the class.

Attendance will be taken in live-meetings online in the mornings at 8am.
Specific details and links for this will be emailed to you closer to the time.
After an initial meeting (probably through Zoom), we will probably use the Canvas internal meeting software. Zoom will remain as a possible backup. 

Please make sure you have a microphone and speakers/headphones to communicate online with. If you are using a webcam, please keep the camera off (As much as I’d love to see you and your pets, there are both liability and bandwidth concerns), and your microphone muted when you are not speaking.
Though do be prepared to speak, ask questions, and answer attendance.

Please also set-up and test your tech before classes begin on July 6th

<h2>Due Dates & Late Work:</h2><b> <ul>
<li>All assignments, projects, due dates, and turn-ins happen through Canvas! </li>
<li>Work will get graded immediately after it is Due.  It will be marked and go into the gradebook as a ZERO if not complete at that time</li>
<li>Work will still be accepted for full credit if turned in up to a day late; possibly more if there are circumstances (try to tell me *before* not *after* though)</li>
<li>Work turned in after that is *way too late* - and will stay a ZERO. </li>
<li>Multiple ZEROs will get a letter sent home.</li>
<li>No work will be accepted after 1pm on Friday, June 17th </li>
</ul></b>

<h2>Course & Grading Breakdown:</h2><b><ul>  
<li>Classwork is 100% of final the grade.  </li>
<li>Each assignment and project has a rubric, and doing that rubric will guarantee you the points and (should) assure that you actually learned what you needed to.  </li>
<li>If you are working ahead of the rest of the class, try to do everything in the rubric; you’ll learn more and it’ll make sure you don’t miss anything.</li>
<li>Everything gets turned in through Canvas.</li>
</ul></b>
What’s this ‘Canvas’ thing that keeps being mentioned?
Canvas is web-based class-management software. It’s a website that you’ll log into, and it’s where all of your assignments are, get turned in, and where grading happens.
(The grades will get transferred to the LWSD Skyward that WANIC uses every so often, but the most up-to-date grades will always be on Canvas).
There are links, pictures, and videos related to assignments – in addition to the assignments and grading rubrics themselves.

There’s a calendar on Canvas, as well as a way to send and receive messages – so you can directly send and receive messages to and from the teacher.
There is also a ‘conferencing’ feature for live meetings (like Zoom, but internal to Canvas) that we will be using twice per day – once in the morning for attendance and morning lessons, and once again at Noon for afternoon lessons.
These sessions will be short – so don’t be late!
Details on how to access Canvas for this course will be coming through email, closer to the beginning of the class.

The main priority of the first meeting (which will likely be a Zoom meeting) will be to ensure everyone can access and navigate Canvas, as it is integral to the course.

The due dates for the above assignments are “By the end of the day that day” – with the notable exception of Project #3 - the final assignment - which is due at 1pm on July 17th.
There are also a few extra-credit assignments along the way in the course that are not listed here.

<h2>Last Thing!</h2>
Oh hi – I’m Conor Tuohy (or ‘Mr. Tuohy’ or ‘That Irish Dude’). 
I teach Computer Science classes at Issaquah High School.
If you – as parents or students - have any questions before or during the class, please contact me! I’m happy to answer questions!
Even questions that are only semi-related, like: “What would you recommend if I/my student wanted to learn more about Computer Science?” or “What are some really good indie-video-games that may change how I think about games as a medium for interactive works of art?” 😊

My email is <a href="mailto:TuohyC@issaquah.wednet.edu">TuohyC@issaquah.wednet.edu</a>contact me through Canvas directly once class begins - I’ll be able to respond much faster on there, so it’s what I’d recommend for day-to-day student/teacher questions.
